* Intro
This package provides a completion command for a simple wiki. And I
mean really simple: it's just a folder with Org files which you can
complete by name:

#+begin_example
org-wiki
├── emacs.org
├── git.org
├── links.org
...
#+end_example

* Setup
#+begin_src elisp
(require 'plain-org-wiki)
(setq pow-directory "~/org/wiki")
#+end_src

* Usage
~M-x~ =plain-org-wiki= gives you a list of all topics you have available
in =pow-directory=. You can also add a new topic by selecting a name not
already on the list.
