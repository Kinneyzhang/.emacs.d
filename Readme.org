#+STARTUP: showall hidestars
* my emacs configuration
** install
   * Clone this repo to your ~/.emacs.d directory. If you already have .emacs.d, back-up it!
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak
       git clone https://github.com/Kinneyzhang/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
     #+END_SRC
   * Start emacs and wait for a while to install all the packages.

** attention
   * The config file is myconfig.org. After you start emacs, emacs will load init.el at first.
   * In init.el, the config "(org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/myconfig.org"))" is important which will compile myconfig as myconfig.el.
   * myconfig.el is the real one emacs will load, but you only have to manage the org file.
   * How to install packages? use "M-x package-install", and add "use package" config in myconfig.org file.
   
** keybindings
   * The package 'Evil' enables us to use the keybindings like Vim. If you are also a vim user, it will be much convenient.
   * The leader-key is ";". Of course, you can change it in init.el.
   * You can also use emacs's default keybindings. Learn more details in myconfig.org.
