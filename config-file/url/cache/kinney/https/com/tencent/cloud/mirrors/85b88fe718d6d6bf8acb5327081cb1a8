;;; Commentary:
;;
;;   Tool for capturing screencasts directly from Emacs.
;;
;;   • To use it, simply call `M-x camcorder-record'.
;;   • A new smaller frame will popup and recording starts.
;;   • When you're finished, hit `F12' and wait for the conversion to
;;     finish.
;;
;;   Screencasts can be generated in any format understood by
;;   `imagemagick''s `convert' command. You can even pause the recording
;;   with `F11'!
;;
;;   If you want to record without a popup frame, use `M-x
;;   camcorder-mode'.
;;
;; Dependencies
;; ────────────
;;
;;   `camcorder.el' uses the [*Names*] package, so if you're installing
;;   manually you need to install that too.
;;
;;   For the recording, `camcorder.el' uses the following linux utilities.
;;   If you have these, it should work out of the box. If you use something
;;   else, you should still be able to configure `camcorder.el' work.
;;
;;   • recordmydesktop
;;   • mplayer
;;   • imagemagick
;;
;;   Do you know of a way to make it work with less dependencies? *Open an
;;   issue and let me know!*
;;
;;
;;   [*Names*] https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/names/
;;
;; Troubleshooting
;; ───────────────
;;
;;   If camcorder.el seems to pick an incorrect window id (differing from the
;;   one that `wminfo' returns), you can change `camcorder-window-id-offset' from its
;;   default value of 0.
